# Project

We chose to redesign the course search system for UNG in order to bring an updated design for students attempting to select their class. The last design was very clunky, uncentered, and unappealing to the studentâ€™s eye. Our design will bring every aspect up to date in order to make it visually satisfying and make it easier for students to select their classes. Not only that, we will possibly be implementing a simplified method in order for users to see information about the given class. We would also like to possibly make it to where once the boxes have a selected option make it highlight green to signify to the user that they can move on to the next box. Also, we will be testing our design by using ethical hacking techniques as well as doing some penetration testing in order to simulate how a suspicious user would be able to gain access to our redesigned website. 


In order to view and interact with our final product, you will have to dowload and unzip the project file (which you have already done if you are reading this), and open the index.html file with a browser of your choice (we recommend Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer). From the project-main folder containing the files index.html, style.css, style1.css, results.html, and this readme file, double-click the index.html file to launch your browser and pull up our finished product (or right click and select open with - browser of your choice).
